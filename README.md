# image-processing-with-opencv-and-pil
Hands-on computer vision lab exercises using Python libraries OpenCV and PIL. Covers basic image reading, manipulation, resizing, color conversion, and channel operations.
# üß† Image Processing with OpenCV and PIL

This repository contains practical lab exercises focused on basic image processing using two widely-used Python libraries: **OpenCV** and **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**. The notebooks are part of a beginner-level Computer Vision course and demonstrate how to load, manipulate, and save images with Python.

## üß™ Objectives

- Understand how to read and display images
- Perform resizing, grayscale conversion, and format changes
- Explore color channel manipulation (RGB, BGR, grayscale)
- Learn how to save manipulated images
- Use both OpenCV and PIL for the same tasks to see differences/similarities
